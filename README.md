# Subset-Generate-using-Bit-mask
When ever any binary number is used to represent any property or like that of any quantity then this binary number is called bit mask of the given quantity . In this c++ code i am using bitmask to generate subset of an array or vector and all subset is stored in a vector then this vector is returned .
